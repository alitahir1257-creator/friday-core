# FRIDAY Core MVP

A small Windows desktop command window backed by the local llama.cpp OpenAI-compatible endpoint. It uses only Python standard-library modules and Tkinter.

## Run

From this directory, run: python friday_core.py

The first command checks http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1. If it is unavailable, FRIDAY starts the configured local launcher at D:\FRIDAY\scripts\friday-local-brain.ps1 with a 4096-token context. No model download, paid API, cloud service, tools, or agent runtime is used.

Edit profile.json to change the assistant name, user name, language, or concise response style.

The `friday` package separates the Tkinter app, local Qwen brain, profile, bounded conversation history, and route labels. The built-in router labels requests as GENERAL, CODING, RESEARCH, COMPUTER, or MEMORY; every route still uses the same Qwen brain.
